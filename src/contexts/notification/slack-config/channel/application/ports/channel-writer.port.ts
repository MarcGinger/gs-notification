 * Channel Writer Port - Interface Segregation Principle Implementation

 * Handles write operations (create, update, delete) for Channel aggregates.

 *
 * ISP Benefits:
 * - Clients that only need to write data don't depend on read methods
 * - Easier to implement write-only scenarios (e.g., event sourcing)
 * - Can be secured separately from read operations
 * - Supports command-only patterns in CQRS architectures
