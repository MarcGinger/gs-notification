		"desc": "# 🧩 Core Webhook Config — General Overview\n\nThe **Core Webhook Config** service is part of the broader **Notification Bounded Context**, responsible for managing all configuration aspects required to send outbound webhooks within the platform. It provides the infrastructure and domain logic that connects a tenant’s webhook endpoints to the notification ecosystem, ensuring secure, structured, and compliant communication between services and external systems.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Purpose\n\nThe primary purpose of **Core Webhook Config** is to manage the lifecycle of webhook-related configuration for each tenant. It defines *where*, *how*, and *under what conditions* webhook payloads are sent. By maintaining configurations in a domain-driven, event-sourced model, the service guarantees auditability, tenant isolation, and consistency across all webhook-related operations.\n\n---\n\n## 🧱 Architectural Role\n\n**Core Webhook Config** acts as the **configuration source of truth** for all webhook integrations in the system. It is not responsible for executing HTTP requests (that’s handled by the **Core Webhook Execute** service), but instead manages the metadata, headers, secrets, retry strategies, and operational policies that determine how webhooks are delivered and authorized.\n\n### Key Roles:\n\n* Acts as the *control plane* for webhook delivery configuration.\n* Provides secure storage and reference handling for signing secrets.\n* Defines approved target URLs and subscribed event types.\n* Publishes domain events consumed by other services (e.g., executors, auditors, or workflow engines).\n* Ensures compliance with audit and retry policies via event sourcing.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Core Components\n\n| Aggregate   | Description                                                                                                     |\n| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Webhook** | Represents an outbound webhook endpoint, including target URL, subscribed event types, HTTP method, and status. |\n| **Config**  | Defines retry/backoff strategies, timeout settings, and operational parameters controlling webhook execution.   |\n\nEach aggregate is event-sourced and projected into Redis for fast reads. The system follows a **CQRS pattern**, separating command writes (EventStoreDB) from queries (Redis projections).\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Data Flow Summary\n\n```\n[API Command] → [Use Case] → [ESDB Writer Repository] → [EventStoreDB]\n       ↓\n[Central Projection Service] → [Redis Snapshot] + [Redis Query Index]\n       ↓\n[Query API] → [Executor / UI / Workflow Consumers]\n```\n\nThis architecture provides full event auditability in **EventStoreDB**, real-time read performance in **Redis**, and flexible event-driven synchronization via **BullMQ** projectors.\n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ Security and Compliance\n\n* **Authentication:** Managed via Keycloak (OAuth2 / OpenID Connect).\n* **Authorization:** Governed by Open Policy Agent (OPA) Rego policies.\n* **Secret Management:** Signing secrets are stored securely using Doppler or another approved secret manager.\n* **Auditability:** Every configuration change emits domain events stored in EventStoreDB, ensuring immutable history and traceability.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Example Use Cases\n\n| Use Case                 | Description                                                                                                         |\n| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Webhook Registration** | When a new webhook is added for a tenant, `WebhookRegistered.v1` and `ConfigUpdated.v1` events are emitted.         |\n| **Retry Policy Update**  | Admins can update retry and timeout parameters, triggering `ConfigUpdated.v1` for executor synchronization.         |\n| **Secret Rotation**      | When a signing secret is rotated, the service emits a new versioned event and updates downstream projections.       |\n| **Subscription Change**  | Tenants can modify the event types their webhook subscribes to, updating routing and executor behavior dynamically. |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Benefits\n\n* **Event-Sourced Reliability:** Every change is versioned, replayable, and fully auditable.\n* **Tenant Isolation:** Each webhook configuration is scoped to a tenant.\n* **High Performance:** Read models are served from Redis with millisecond-level latency.\n* **Extensible Design:** Supports additional delivery settings (e.g., per-event policies, delivery headers) in future iterations.\n* **Integration Friendly:** Provides consistent event naming and structure compatible with other notification channels (Slack, Email, SMS).\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Summary\n\nThe **Core Webhook Config** service provides the configuration backbone for all webhook-based notifications. It ensures that every outbound webhook:\n\n* Is securely configured and authorized.\n* Uses approved and auditable endpoints.\n* Follows consistent retry and timeout policies.\n* Operates under event-sourced, tenant-aware control.\n\nThis service is a critical component of the Notification Bounded Context, enabling scalable, reliable, and compliant webhook integration within a modern, event-driven architecture.\n",
